          second official member of the Straw Hat Pirates.
          Zoro was working as a bounty hunter and had earned the fearsome title of “Pirate Hunter Zoro” before meeting
          Luffy. Like Luffy, Zoro too has a dream and aims to become the world’s greatest swordsman

          Nami is the second member to join Luffy and the Straw Hat pirates as the Navigator during the Orange Town arc.
          But she tricked Luffy and joined the crew only to steal money from them to reclaim her village from the Arlong
          pirates.
          She was a member of the Arlong pirates during that time. But after Luffy learns about this incident, he
          rescues the village by beating the Arlong pirates.
          Nami later officially joins the Straw Hat Pirates at the end of the Arlong Park arc, pursuing her dream to
          make the map of the entire planet.

          the Straw Hat Pirates as the Sniper. He initially led the Usopp Pirates crew,
          but he joined Luffy’s crew at the end of the Syrup Village arc. After Luffy befriended him and helped save his
          friend Kaya,
          Ussop accepted the invitation to the Straw Hats to become a brave warrior of the sea like his father. His
          father was Yasopp (from Red Hair pirates),
          and he mentioned Usopp to Luffy when he was a kid. Usopp’s friend Kaya gifted the Going Merry ship to Luffy,
          helping them kick off their journey to the Grand Line. </div>

        <div class="content">Sanji is the fourth member to join the Straw Hat pirates as the Cook at the end of the
          Baratie arc in One Piece.
          One of the important things for Luffy is obviously food, and he has the best chef in the world in his crew.
          Sanji dreams to find All Blue,
          a sea legend that refers to the only place where the North Blue, South Blue, East Blue, and West Blue seas
          meet in the One Piece world. This was also the dream of Sanji’s mentor Zeff.
          So he decided to join Luffy’s crew in their adventures across the world to fulfill his dream.</div>

        <div class="content">
          Tony Tony Chopper is the fifth member to join the Straw Hat Pirates crew as the Doctor.
          It is important for every crew to have a doctor on the ship. Chopper isn’t a human but a reindeer. He got this
          human hybrid form after eating the Hito Hito no Mi devil fruit.
          Chopper aims to become the best doctor in the world and cure all incurable diseases by traveling around the
          world. So like others,
          he joined Luffy’s crew to pursue his dream

        <div class="name">NICO ROBIN</div>
        <div class="content">
          Nico Robin is the sixth member to become part of the Straw Hat Pirates in One Piece. She joined the crew as
          the Archaeologist, and she did it in a surprising way too. Nico was first seen as an antagonist during the
          Arabasta arc but later joined the crew to pursue her dream of uncovering the history of the world, especially
          during the Void Century.
          She is one of the only two members in the world who can actually read the poneglyphs. Since Luffy wants to
          reach the Laugh Tale and find the One Piece treasure, it cannot be done without the help of Nico Robin

        <div class="content">
          Franky is the seventh member to join the crew as the Shipwright at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby arc.
          Similar to Robin, he was initially considered to be a villain of the Straw Hats, but he turned into an ally
          and made up for his mistakes by building an absolutely beautiful ship for the Straw Hats. He dreamt of
          building a ship and traveling all over the world on it, therefore, he accepted Luffy’s
          invitation to become a member of the crew.

        <div class="name">BROOK</div>
        <div class="content">
          Brook is the eighth member to join the Straw Hat Pirates as the Musician in the One Piece anime. He joined the
          crew at the end of the Thriller Bark arc as Luffy always wanted to have a musician in his crew. Brook ate the
          Yomi Yomi no Mi devil fruit, allowing him to come back from the dead. He was living alone for 50 years in the
          Florian Triangle, but luckily, he met Luffy on his voyage to Thriller Bark. And without hesitation, Luffy
          invited Brook to join them when he was only a skeleton roaming the seas.

        <div class="name">JINBE</div>
        <div class="content">
          Jinbe is the ninth member to join the Straw Hat pirates as the Helmsman. Among everyone else, Jinbe was the
          only one we waited years to join the crew. Luffy befriended Jinbe during the Impel Down arc and invited him
          during the Fishman Island arc. As Jinbe was an ally of the Big Mom Pirates, he had to cut ties with her and
          promised Luffy to join the crew in the Wano country.

          This even became a popular meme among the One Piece fandom, in which Luffy says, “I’ll be waiting for you at
          the Land of Wano!” Jinbe finally reunited with the Straw Hat Pirates
